# Calculator in C++ (Self-taught)

Welcome to my extremely messy and unusual way to code a calculator without the help of tutorials. Every functionality is derived from my ideas and it will reflect on the way the code is structured and written. This project is for **practice** to allow myself to become a better programmer in the future.

Sit back and mald as you watch each version update be detailed in this documentation.
